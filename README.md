Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is an open-source project to build a multi-protocol, embeddable, very high performance, clustered, asynchronous messaging system.

This .NET client library is an open-source effort to equip .NET developers with a powerful, straightforward client for Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Utilizing the broker's Core protocol, this library focuses on high-performance messaging, ensuring compatibility and comprehensive feature support with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this project is currently under active development and is not considered production-ready. We are continuously working to improve and stabilize its features, but it does not yet meet all the requirements for production use.

If you are in search of a production-ready ActiveMQ Artemis client for .NET, we recommend checking out the [AMQP-based client](https://github.com/Havret/dotnet-activemq-artemis-client). This alternative client has been battle-tested in production environments for the last few years and supports a wide range of ActiveMQ Artemis features.
