Apache ActiveMQ Artemis is an open-source project to build a multi-protocol, embeddable, very high performance, clustered, asynchronous messaging system.

This project is an open-source initiative designed to provide .NET developers with a robust, efficient, and easy-to-use client library for interacting with Apache ActiveMQ Artemis message broker. By leveraging the native Core protocol of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, this client library aims to deliver high-performance messaging capabilities while ensuring compatibility and feature parity with the broker's extensive features set.
